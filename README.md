# School Exam 2022 - Layout (3/3)

## Advice
This is not meant to be used as a cheat, it is meant to show part of my progress, for this reason i did not announce the name of the school and neither the exam. I hope this will only be used as a reference of my coding ability as an student.

## Requirements 
This exercise require the developer to develop a layout with: 
* 750px total width layout;
* 100px height header;
* superior menu;
* 150px left column [ navigation menu ] :

``` 
<ul> <br>
  <li><a href=”#”>Link1</a></li> <br>
  <li><a href=”#”>Link2</a></li> <br>
  <li><a href=”#”>Link3</a></li> <br>
  <li><a href=”#”>Link4</a></li> <br>
  <li><a href=”#”>Link5</a></li> <br>
</ul> 
``` 

* 450px center column [ content area ]:
  + Create a form;
  + [input] Name: "Insert your full name"
  + [input] Email: "Insert you email adress"
  + [input] Phone: "insert your phone"
  + [textArea] Message: "Insert your message"
  + [toogle] "i agree with the terms and conditions" ( terms and conditions is a link )
* 150px right column;
* those 3 columns should have variable height;
* footer;

## Extra
Develop a software wich:
* gets [undetermined times]: 
  + name;
  + first semester grade;
  + second semester grade;
  + frequency;
* returns table with:
  + student id ( don't have a table header );
  + name;
  + first semester grade;
  + second semester grade;
  + grade average; 
  + frequency;
  + colored rows: 
    - green if passed;
    - red if did not passed;
